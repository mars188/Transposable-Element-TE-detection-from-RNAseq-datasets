TE studies done at the subfamily level are unable to distinguish TE-intrinsic expression via TE-derived regulatory sequences from TEextrinsic expression due to TE inclusion in a longer transcript. 
Conversely, RNA-seq pipelines that rely solely on uniquely aligning reads can miss differential expression of highly repetitive TEs.
The vast sequence diversity of TEs combined with the complexity of mutations that occur after insertion makes automated TE identification and classification a daunting task.
